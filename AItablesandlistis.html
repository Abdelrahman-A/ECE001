    <td><ul>General AI is a type of intelligence which could perform any intellectual task with efficiency like a human.</ul>
      <ul>The idea behind the general AI to make such a system which could be smarter and think like a human by its own.</ul>
      <ul>Currently, there is no such system exist which could come under general AI and can perform any task as perfect as a human.</ul>
      <ul>The worldwide researchers are now focused on developing machines with General AI.</ul>
      <ul> As systems with general AI are still under research, and it will take lots of efforts and time to develop such systems.</ul> </td>
    <td>  <ul>>Super AI is a level of Intelligence of Systems at which machines could surpass human intelligence, and can perform any task better than human with cognitive properties. It is an outcome of general AI.</ul>
      <ul> Some key characteristics of strong AI include capability include the ability to think, to reason,solve the puzzle, make judgments, plan, learn, and communicate by its own.</ul>
      <ul> Super AI is still a hypothetical concept of Artificial Intelligence. Development of such systems in real is still world changing task.</ul></td>
